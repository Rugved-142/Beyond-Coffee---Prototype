## About Beyond Coffee

Beyond Coffee is a smart, innovative platform designed to revolutionize the way coffee lovers interact with their favorite brew. Whether you’re a casual drinker or a coffee aficionado, Beyond Coffee blends technology and passion to deliver personalized coffee recommendations, brewing tips, and an engaging community experience — all beyond just a cup of coffee.

## Prototype Features & User Insights

- **Rewards Don’t Feel Personal**  
  Users want to customize their rewards to match their preferences. Currently, the loyalty program feels generic and lacks excitement.

- **Difficulty in Ordering for Visually Impaired Users**  
  Without a voice assistant, placing orders is challenging for visually impaired users. A hands-free ordering system would enable more independent and seamless interactions.

- **Uncertainty About Seating**  
  Users dislike arriving only to find no available seating. Checking seating availability beforehand would be valuable, especially for those needing a workspace.

- **No Clear Order Updates**  
  Users often wonder about their order status—whether it’s being cooked, packed, or ready for pickup. Real-time progress updates would reduce wait-time frustration.

- **Hard to Visualize Menu Items**  
  Users wish to see how food or drinks would look before ordering to make better decisions and avoid surprises regarding portion size or presentation.

## Technologies Used
 
- **Moqups** for medium-fidelity wireframes and interactive mockups
